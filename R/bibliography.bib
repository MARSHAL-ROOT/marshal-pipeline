              in the soil-root system, at multiple scales (tissue, organ, plant

              within the network. We also demonstrate the novel possibilities
              of scale-consistent parameterizations made possible by the
              network with a set of case studies from the literature. Finally,

              for managing plant irrigation and developing drought-tolerant
              root system ideotypes (i.e. ideal root systems). Today,
              three-dimensional structural functional models exist, which
              allows solving the water flow equation in the soil and in the
              root systems under transient conditions and in heterogeneous
              soils. Yet, these models rely on the full representation of the
              three-dimensional distribution of the root hydraulic properties,
              which is not always easy to access. Recently, new models able to
              represent this complex system without the full knowledge of the

              the distance between laterals, the number of primaries or the

  abstract  = "In 1978, Landsberg and Fowkes presented a solution of the water
               flow equation inside a root with uniform hydraulic properties.
               These properties are root radial conductivity and axial
               conductance, which control, respectively, the radial water flow
               between the root surface and xylem and the axial flow within the
               xylem. From the solution for the xylem water potential,
               functions that describe the radial and axial flow along the root
               axis were derived. These solutions can also be used to derive
               root macroscopic parameters that are potential input parameters
               of hydrological and crop models. In this paper, novel analytical
               solutions of the water flow equation are developed for roots
               whose hydraulic properties vary along their axis, which is the
               case for most plants. We derived solutions for single roots with
               linear or exponential variations of hydraulic properties with
               distance to root tip. These solutions were subsequently combined
               to construct single roots with complex hydraulic property
               profiles. The analytical solutions allow one to verify numerical
               solutions and to get a generalization of the hydric behaviour
               with the main influencing parameters of the solutions. The
               resulting flow distributions in heterogeneous roots differed
               from those in uniform roots and simulations led to more regular,
               less abrupt variations of xylem suction or radial flux along
               root axes. The model could successfully be applied to maize
               effective root conductance measurements to derive radial and
               axial hydraulic properties. We also show that very contrasted
               root water uptake patterns arise when using either uniform or
               heterogeneous root hydraulic properties in a soil--root model.
               The optimal root radius that maximizes water uptake under a
               carbon cost constraint was also studied. The optimal radius was
               shown to be highly dependent on the root hydraulic properties
               and close to observed properties in maize roots. We finally used
               the obtained functions for evaluating the impact of root
               maturation versus root growth on water uptake. Very diverse
               uptake strategies arise from the analysis. These solutions open
               new avenues to investigate for optimal
               genotype--environment--management interactions by optimization,
               for example, of plant-scale macroscopic hydraulic parameters

              sites in soil where roots provide input of carbon and take up
              water and solutes. However, root architecture is difficult to
              determine experimentally when grown in opaque soil. Thus, root
              architecture models have been widely used and been further
              developed into functional--structural models that simulate the
              fate of water and solutes in the soil--root system. The root
              architecture model CRootBox presented here is a flexible
              framework to model root architecture and its interactions with
              static and dynamic soil environments.MethodsCRootBox is a
              C++-based root architecture model with Python binding, so that
              CRootBox can be included via a shared library into any Python
              code. Output formats include VTP, DGF, RSML and a plain text file
              containing coordinates of root nodes. Furthermore, a database of
              published root architecture parameters was created. The
              capabilities of CRootBox for the unconfined growth of single root
              systems, as well as the different parameter sets, are highlighted
              in a freely available web application.Key resultsThe capabilities
              of CRootBox are demonstrated through five different cases: (1)
              free growth of individual root systems; (2) growth of root
              systems in containers as a way to mimic experimental setups; (3)
              field-scale simulation; (4) root growth as affected by
              heterogeneous, static soil conditions; and (5) coupling CRootBox
              with code from the book Soil physics with Python to dynamically
              compute water flow in soil, root water uptake and water flow
              inside roots.ConclusionsCRootBox is a fast and flexible
              functional--structural root model that is based on
              state-of-the-art computational science methods. Its aim is to
              facilitate modelling of root responses to environmental
              conditions as well as the impact of roots on soil. In the future,

  abstract  = "Abstract. Many hydrological models including root water uptake
               (RWU) do not consider the dimension of root system hydraulic
               architecture (HA) because explicitly solving water flow in such
               a complex system is too time consuming. However, they might lack
               process understanding when basing RWU and plant water stress
               predictions on functions of variables such as the root length
               density distribution. On the basis of analytical solutions of
               water flow in a simple HA, we developed an ``implicit'' model of
               the root system HA for simulation of RWU distribution (sink term
               of Richards' equation) and plant water stress in
               three-dimensional soil water flow models. The new model has
               three macroscopic parameters defined at the soil element scale,
               or at the plant scale, rather than for each segment of the root
               system architecture: the standard sink fraction distribution
               SSF, the root system equivalent conductance Krs and the
               compensatory RWU conductance Kcomp. It clearly decouples the
               process of water stress from compensatory RWU, and its structure
               is appropriate for hydraulic lift simulation. As compared to a
               model explicitly solving water flow in a realistic maize root
               system HA, the implicit model showed to be accurate for
               predicting RWU distribution and plant collar water potential,
               with one single set of parameters, in dissimilar water dynamics
               scenarios. For these scenarios, the computing time of the
               implicit model was a factor 28 to 214 shorter than that of the
               explicit one. We also provide a new expression for the effective
               soil water potential sensed by plants in soils with a
               heterogeneous water potential distribution, which emerged from
               the implicit model equations. With the proposed implicit model
               of the root system HA, new concepts are brought which open
               avenues towards simple and mechanistic RWU models and water
               stress functions operational for field scale water dynamics

               estimates of the economic consequences of this capture to be
